This repository contains an implementation of a simple machine emulator called the VOLE Machine. It simulates a basic CPU that can execute a set of instructions and manipulate registers and memory. The program is divided into several components, including the CPU, ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit), Control Unit (CU), Registers, and Memory. The CPU coordinates the execution of instructions by fetching from memory, decoding, and executing based on the instruction set. The ALU handles arithmetic operations such as addition, while the Control Unit (CU) manages control flow, including loading and storing data, moving data between registers, performing arithmetic operations, jumping to memory addresses, and halting the program. The Register class holds a set of registers (16 total), and the Memory class simulates a memory space of 256 bytes. The program can either load instructions manually through user input or read them from a file. The user interface (MainUI) provides an interactive console to input instructions, display memory and register states, and execute or load a program step-by-step. This allows the user to simulate a simple assembly-like language where memory and register operations are visible and can be traced step-by-step. The program uses hexadecimal addressing and supports instruction types such as LOAD, STORE, ADD, MOVE, and JUMP. Users can enter their own programs or load a program from a file, and the emulator will execute the instructions until a halt instruction (C000) is encountered.
