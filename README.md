The Machine Simulator is built on several basic classes that work together to execute machine-level instructions, emulating the operations of a real processor. Centered around the Machine class, it integrates the CPU, Memory, and MainUI. The CPU processes instructions using its Control Unit (CU) for managing operations and an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) for calculations, while the Memory class stores all necessary data and instructions. It reads instructions from a text file and executes them one by one, following the “fetch-decode-execute” cycle. Quick access to important data during processing is facilitated by the CPU’s registers. Users can easily interact with the simulator through the MainUI, allowing them to enter programs and view results. Together, these components create a cohesive and efficient system for reading and executing instructions
